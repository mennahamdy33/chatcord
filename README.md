## Virtual Kidney Clinic
### The patient has two options
 1. Go Direct To Chat Room To Talk to the
Doctor
 2. Answer Some Questions which help the
patient to see if there is something to worry
about or he should talk to a doctor
“Machine Learning Used Here and we use
RandomForest Classifier”

 The doctor enters The username and password and
directly go to the chat room

 It’s a multi-client Socket Connection and any data the
client enters from User Interface must go first to the
server.
